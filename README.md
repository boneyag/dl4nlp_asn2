# dl4nlp_asn2
Assignment 2 - DL4NLP

The project only contain the `src` directory. Since pickled files are two large, those are not pushed to the repo. But the code can generate them very easily. 

1. Clone the repo.
2. Create two directories, data and serialized as shown in the directory tree structure below. Add the train and test data from the to the data dir. 
   `mkdir data`
   `mkdir serialized`
3. Move to the src dir. `cd src`
4. Run the main script. `python3 main.py`


```

   |--test\ 
   |--train\ 
|--serialized\
|--src\
   |--logistic_reg.py
   |--main.py
   |--pre_data.py   
|--test\
```
